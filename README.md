#about me
Iâ€™m a statistics student at the **University of Auckland**. I love animals.

#This is my meme.

Below is a meme I made using the R package {magick}.https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html

some information of my inspiration for the meme is:

*a white cat drinking milk tea
*a bear blowing bubbles
*a panda hugging love

I also probably should provide the R code I used to make the meme!
